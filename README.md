# PrMan Privmar Tool - v0.2.0
Artist friendly tool for using RenderMan's Primitive Variables in Maya.

[Documentation](http://alijafargholi.github.io/prman_rfmPrimVarTool/)

When you want variation from your RenderMan shader, you could use Primvar.
This RenderMan functionality gives you the ability to use only one shader for
many objects and create variety at render time. But the process of assigning
these attributes could be time consuming and discouraging for an artist.

To make this process easier, I created a tool that speeds up the process.
Primvar Manager for Maya.

Default Installation
====================

1. [Download the Package](https://github.com/alijafargholi/prman_rfmPrimVarTool/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file and rename it to **rfmPrimVarTool**.
3. Then move the entire *rfmPrimVarTool*  folder to the specified path:
    * Mac OS X
        * ~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/scripts
    * Linux
        * /maya/\<version>/scripts
    * Windows
        * \<drive>:\Documents and Settings\\\<username>\\My Documents\\maya\\scripts

4. Then in a new instance of Maya, open the script editor and run the following
 in a *Python* tab:

    ```python
    from rfmPrimVarTool.src import primVarApp
    reload(primVarApp)
    primVarApp.create_ui()
    ```

Custom Installation
===================

In case you don't have access to any of the above location, you can install this tool in a custom location. Following steps describe how to do it:

1. [Download the Package](https://github.com/alijafargholi/prman_rfmPrimVarTool/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file and rename it to **rfmPrimVarTool**.
3. Then move the entire *rfmPrimVarTool* folder to any location you want:
4. Then in a new instance of Maya, open the script editor and run the following in a *Python* tab:

    ```python
    import sys, os

    # Update this path to where you copied the package
    PATH_TO_PACKAGE = r"REPLACE/ME/WITH/PATH/TO/WHERE/YOU/COPIED/THE/PACKAGE"

    src_path = os.path.realpath(PATH_TO_PACKAGE)

    # Adding the location to system path
    if not src_path in sys.path:
       sys.path.append(src_path)
       print "added {} to the path\n".format(src_path)

    from rfmPrimVarTool.src import primVarApp
    reload(primVarApp)
    primVarApp.create_ui()
    ```

    **Make sure you set the PATH_TO_PACKAGE to where you copied the *rfmPrimVarTool* package**

    > example:

    > If the path to *rfmPrimVarTool* is this:

    > **/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/scripts/rfmPrimVarTool**

    > Then you need to set the *PATH_TO_PACKAGE* as follow:

    > **PATH_TO_PACKAGE = r"/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/scripts"**

----

> Note:
> Probably you don't want to run the script from the python tab
every time you wan to open the tool, you could drag and drop the code from the *python* tab to a *shell*
